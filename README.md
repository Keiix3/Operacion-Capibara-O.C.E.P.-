## 🎮 What is this?

O.C.E.P. is a chaotic top-down shooter where a squad of unlikely agents fights back an alien invasion. The game supports solo and local co-op play, with multiple mission types, five unique playable characters and a full enemy bestiary.

This project was not built to show coding skills. It was built to learn through doing — applying product thinking, systems design and QA principles to something tangible and fun.

## 🧠 My Role

The code was developed with AI assistance. My role throughout the project was **product owner and designer**:

- Defining game mechanics, character abilities and mission structure from scratch
- Balancing gameplay: damage values, cooldowns, enemy behavior, spawn logic
- Acting as QA: testing edge cases, identifying bugs, deciding what to fix and why
- Iterating over a dozen development sessions based on what actually worked in play
- Making scope decisions — what to include, what to cut, what to defer

It became my most hands-on experience in systems thinking and applied quality assurance.

## 👥 Characters

| Agent | Class | Passive Ability |
|---|---|---|
| Cmdt. Carpincho | Leader | Team aura: grants +1 life every 45s, speed buff to nearby allies |
| Agente Bigotes | Infiltrator | Shadow: +35% fire rate when aiming, harder for enemies to detect |
| Tanque 'Mate' | Heavy | Armor: -15% damage taken, status effects last 50% less |
| Dra. Miau | Medic | Triage: 40% faster healing, heals nearby ally when using bandage |
| Cabo Caparazón | Artillerist | Logistics: 40% faster reload on both weapons, auto-reload on swap |

## 👾 Enemy Bestiary

- **Tanque** — slow but extremely high HP, suppressive fire
- **Acechador** — maintains mid range, acid projectiles
- **Ralentizador** — slows players with debuff shots

## 📌 Notes

This project is a personal learning exercise, not a commercial product. It's intentionally rough around the edges. The value was in the process: designing systems, breaking them, fixing them, and understanding why things go wrong.

If you're curious about the design decisions behind any mechanic, feel free to open an issue or reach out.
